# Patient Zero Docker setup

There are two main parts of the application

- `back-end`
- `front-end`

They both hold their own `README.md` so please follow them if you need further information.

## Setup
This helps setting up the database and start the application in docker.

From terminal run:
- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`
